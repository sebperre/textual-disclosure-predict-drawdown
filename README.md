# 🏃 INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING 🏃

## 🚀 Tutorial

### 1. Install dependencies

Run the following commands inside the **project root** (`COMP545-Final-Project`):

- Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

- Select the virtual environment as your interpreter

- Install all dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. Gather Data

As the datasets are too large, you will have to retrieve them from WRDS. Gather the text filings and the price, GVKey and stock return data.

### 3. Run exploratory_analysis, experiments, and plots

Run the code in `src/prepare_dataset` then `benchmark_models.ipynb` and finally `text_based_models.ipynb`.
